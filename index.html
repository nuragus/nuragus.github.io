Compared to GPT-5, Codex is more steerable, adheres closely to developer instructions, and produces cleaner, higher-quality code outputs. Reasoning effort can be adjusted with the `reasoning.effort` parameter. Read the [docs here](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#reasoning-effort-level)\n\nCodex integrates into developer environments including the CLI, IDE extensions, GitHub, and cloud tasks. It adapts reasoning effort dynamically—providing fast responses for small tasks while sustaining extended multi-hour runs for large projects. The model is trained to perform structured code reviews, catching critical flaws by reasoning over dependencies and validating behavior against tests. It also supports multimodal inputs such as images or screenshots for UI development and integrates tool use for search, dependency installation, and environment setup.

[Learn more in our docs](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#enable-reasoning-with-default-config)\n\nThe model is instruction-tuned with an expanded post-training corpus (~60B tokens) emphasizing reasoning traces, improving performance in math, code, STEM, and logical reasoning, while retaining broad assistant utility. It also supports structured outputs, including JSON mode, schema adherence, function calling, and tool use. Hermes 4 is trained for steerability, lower refusal rates, and alignment toward neutral, user-directed behavior.">

Specifically, it combines features from previous Llama Guard models, providing content moderation for English and multiple supported languages, along with enhanced capabilities to handle mixed text-and-image prompts, including multiple images. Additionally, Llama Guard 4 is integrated into the Llama Moderations API, extending robust safety classification to text and images.">

All artifacts used in creating Molmo (PixMo dataset, training code, evaluations, intermediate checkpoints) will be made available at a later date, furthering our commitment to open-source AI development and reproducibility.">

Searches are priced at $5/1000 searches. A request that does 30 searches will cost $0.15 in this step.\n- Reasoning is a distinct step in Deep Research since it does extensive automated reasoning through all the material it gathers during its research phase.
